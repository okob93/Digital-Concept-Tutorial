I will be talking about encoding/decoding ASCII messages and converting between decimal and binary representations of numerical values.
The four most common number system types are:  
Decimal number system (Base- 10)(In base 10 there are ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9).  
Binary number system (Base- 2)(binary (or base 2) which has 2 digits: 0 and 1).  
Octal number system (Base-8)( In base 8 there are 8 digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7).  
Hexadecimal number system (Base- 16)(In base 16 there are 16 digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F).
